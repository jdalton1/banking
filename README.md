# Overview

This is my first program written in Kotlin. It is very simple, and uses basic coding concepts such as conditional statements, a while loop, functions, and a class. 

A simple Banking program that gets a users name and age, as well as an account balance. The account balance can then be added to or subtracted.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

* IntellijIdea Community

* Kotlin
* Java Libraries (Scanner)

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work

* File or cloud storage to add multiple users and store various balances that will not reset upon restarting the program
* The option to have multiple accounts such as a checking and savings account with separate balance
* Basic security such as a pin to link a user with account info
